# Biocad Internship Task

Generate random float parameters on OPC UA Server. Write service that would read generated values and compare them with specified emergency limits. If limits are exceeded, the service will send notification to Telegram bot about that event.

# About solution

I still don't know how OPC UA properly works 'coz its specification has paywall and I had no time to dig into it. Plus, I only finished tour of Go, so this task was like an entertainment. No more, no less.
